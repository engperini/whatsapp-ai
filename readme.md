# ü§ñ WhatsApp AI Personal Bot

This is a **personal chatbot project integrated with WhatsApp**, designed to automatically reply to messages in your own communication style: direct, informal, practical, and without sounding like a generic AI.

The bot uses the **OpenAI API** + **TextMeBot API** to send and receive messages on WhatsApp, and keeps a conversation history to answer in a personalized and contextualized way.

## üîß TextMeBot API Configuration (your responsability, I am just a user sharing my use case, I am not afiliate with textmebot )

**TextMeBot** is a simple and low-cost API that allows you to send WhatsApp messages using your own number.  
This bot uses the **paid plan** to allow your number to send messages to any number.

### 1) Get your API Key

1. Access the official website: [https://textmebot.com/](https://textmebot.com/)
2. Click on **Request API Key** and follow the instructions.
3. You will receive an email with your API Key and instructions to link your WhatsApp number.

### 2) Link your WhatsApp number

1. Use the link provided in the email to connect your WhatsApp number to the API.
2. Follow the instructions to confirm your number is correctly associated.

### 3) Send Text Messages

To send a message, use the following URL format:

```
http://api.textmebot.com/send.php?recipient=[phone_number]&apikey=[your_apikey]&text=[message_to_send]
```

**Example:**

```
http://api.textmebot.com/send.php?recipient=+5511999999999&apikey=YOURAPIKEY&text=Hello%20world!
```

To receive the response in JSON format, add `&json=yes` to the URL.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** Sending messages to people who don't expect them may result in your WhatsApp number being blocked.  
Use the API responsibly and implement a minimum delay of 5 seconds between messages to reduce this risk.

---

### 4) Receive Incoming Messages (Webhook)

To receive incoming messages to your WhatsApp number, configure a webhook:

1. Access: [https://api.textmebot.com/webhook.php?apikey=YOURAPIKEY](https://api.textmebot.com/webhook.php?apikey=YOURAPIKEY)
2. Set the endpoint URL that will receive incoming messages in JSON format.

Incoming messages will follow this structure:

```json
{
  "type": "text",
  "from": "5511999999999",
  "from_name": "Sender Name",
  "to": "5511888888888",
  "file": null,
  "message": "Message received on WhatsApp"
}
```

For more details, visit: [TextMeBot Webhook Documentation](https://api.textmebot.com/web_receive.php)

---

### 5) Send Images and Documents

You can send files hosted on public services like Google Drive.  
Make sure the file is **publicly shared** and use the URL in the `file` or `document` parameter.

**Example to send an image:**

```
http://api.textmebot.com/send.php?recipient=+5511999999999&apikey=YOURAPIKEY&text=Here's%20the%20image&file=[FILE_URL]
```

**Note:** When using Google Drive, make sure the file is set to "Anyone with the link can view."

---

### 6) Send Messages from Google Sheets

You can integrate TextMeBot with Google Sheets to send messages to multiple recipients:

1. Create a sheet with phone numbers and messages.
2. Use **Google Apps Script** to automate message sending using the TextMeBot API.

### 7) Important Recommendations

- **Avoid Spam:** Never send unsolicited messages to unknown contacts. It may lead to your WhatsApp number being blocked.
- **Message Delay:** Always include a minimum delay of 5 seconds between message sends.
- **Dedicated Number:** Use a dedicated number for the API, separate from your personal number.
